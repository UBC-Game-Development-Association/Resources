# 3D Modelling

3D modelling is generally the process of creating digital representations of surfaces in three dimensional spaces. For the purposes of game development, this will be either through poly modelling or sculpting.
A common workflow in game development might look something like Modelling -> UV Mapping -> Texturing -> Baking -> Rigging -> Animation -> Export, but many steps like baking and rigging may not be necessary depending on the model's purpose.
It is important to note that many programs disagree on how to handle 3D space or express textures.

## Poly Modelling
### Blender 
Blender is a free and open source 3D Modelling suite with a large online community. Tutorials from before Blender 2.8 will be very hard to follow, 2.8 and onward will generally be quite similar.

  - This is a very traditional Blender tutorial. It can be somewhat controversial, but is a very good survey of many of Blender's tools, not all of which are going to be used in GameDev tasks.

### Maya
Maya is Autodesk's industry standard 3D Poly Modelling software. A student license can be acquired for free, for learning and non-commercial use by sending Autodesk evidence of enrollment.
