# 3D Modelling

3D modelling is generally the process of creating digital representations of surfaces in three dimensional spaces. For the purposes of game development, this will be either through poly modelling or sculpting.
A common workflow in game development might look something like Modelling -> UV Mapping -> Texturing -> Baking -> Rigging -> Animation -> Export, but many steps like baking and rigging may not be necessary depending on the model's purpose.
It is important to note that many programs disagree on how to handle 3D space or express textures.
